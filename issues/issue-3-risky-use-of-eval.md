# Issue #3: Risky Use of `eval`

The `validateAndSetArgument` function uses `eval` to set variables from user input. While the current usage appears safe as the variable names are controlled by the script, using `eval` is generally considered risky as it can execute arbitrary code if not handled carefully. A safer alternative, like a `case` statement to handle expected arguments, would be more robust.
