# LLM Council

![Logo](docs/logo/logo.640x320.jpg)

Start a chat room between all, or some, of your models running on Ollama.

All in a single Bash shell script.

See example chats in the [./docs/demos/](./docs/demos) directory.

## Usage

```
Usage:
  ./council.sh [flags]
  ./council.sh [flags] [topic]

Flags:
  -m model1,model2  Use specific models (comma separated list)
  -r,  -reply      User may respond after every model message
  -nu, -nouser     No user in chat, only models (Default)
  -to, -timeout    Set timeout to # seconds
  -ts, -timestamp  Show Date and time for every message
  -w,  -wrap       Text wrap lines to # characters
  -nc, -nocolors   Do not use ANSI colors
  -d,  -debug      Debug Mode
  -v,  -version    Show version information
  -h,  -help       Help for llm-council
  [topic]           Set the chat room topic (Optional)
```

## How it works

Model chats are in the round:
- A round is a list of all models, randomly sorted.
- The first model in the round is asked to chat, then removed from the round.
- Then the next model is asked to chat, and so on.
- When the round is done (all models have chatted) then a new round is started.

## Chat Commands

All chat participants, models and user, may use these commands:

- ```/topic <new topic>```
- ```/quit <optional reason>```

## Logging

Log files save the chat instructions, and the chat message log:
- ```./instructions.txt```
- ```./messages.txt```

If log files already exist, they are overwritten when the script is run again.

## Usage Examples

- Run the council with all available Ollama models, 
  entering the prompt interactively,
  and with no user interaction:
  ```
  ./council.sh
  ```

- Run the council with all available Ollama models,
  entering the prompt interactively,
  and prompt user to respond after every model message.
  (Press enter to skip your turn)
  ```
  ./council.sh -reply
  ```

- Run the council with all available Ollama models
  setting the /topic on the command line:
  ```
  ./council.sh "Let us work together and create world peace"
  ```
    
- Specify which models to use in the council:
  ```
  ./council.sh -models gemma3n:e4b,mistral:7b,granite3.3:8b
  ```

- Set the timeout (in seconds) for model responses.
  (Default is 30 seconds)
  ```
  ./council.sh -timeout 60
  ```

- Show timestamps with ever message:
  ```
  ./council.sh -timestamp
  ```

- Wrap lines to # characters
  ```
  ./council.sh -wrap 80
  ```

- Usage help:
  ```
  ./council.sh -h
  ```

- To stop the council, press **Control-C**
  - You may have to wait until the current model finishes responding before the chat will stop.

## Example chat:

```
% ./council.sh -models gemma3n:e4b,mistral:7b,granite3.3:8b -wrap 75 -nocolor "Welcome to the chat"
