![Logo](docs/logo/logo.640x320.jpg)

All in a single Bash shell script.

See the [example chats](#example-chat) for demo chat logs.

```
Usage:
  ./council.sh [flags]
  ./council.sh [flags] [topic]

Flags:
  -m model1,model2  Use specific models (comma separated list)
  -r,  -reply       User may respond after every model message
  -nu, -nouser      No user in chat, only models (Default)
  -to, -timeout     Set timeout to # seconds
  -ts, -timestamp   Show Date and time for every message
  -se, -showempty   Show Empty messages (from timeouts)

  [topic]           Set the chat room topic (Optional)
```

## Chat Commands

```
Chat Commands:

/topic [Your Topic]      - Set a new topic
/quit (optional reason)  - Leave the chat

Admin Commands:

/stop            - Close the chat and exit
/count           - Show number of models in chat
/list            - List models in chat
/olist           - Show available models in Ollama
/ps              - Show running models in Ollama
/kick [model]    - Kick model out of the chat
/invite [model]  - Invite model into the chat
/rules           - View the Chat Instructions sent to models
```

## How it works

Model chats are in the round:
- A round starts with a list of all models, randomly sorted.
- The first model in the round is asked to chat.
  - The model must respond within the timeout period,
    otherwise its response is truncated.
- When the first model finishes, it is removed from the round.
- If the user is in the chat, they are given the option to respond.
- Then the next model in the round is asked to chat, and so on.
- When the round is done (all models have chatted),
  then a new round is started.

## Logging

Logs are saved in the ```./logs``` directory.

Every time the script is run, the model instructions and chat log are saved to files.

The model instructions are saved to ```./logs/instructions.txt```

The chat log is saved to ```./logs/messages.txt```

New chats are appended to the message log.

## Usage Examples

- Run the council with all available Ollama models, 
  entering the prompt interactively,
  and with no user interaction:
  ```
  ./council.sh
  ```

- Run the council with all available Ollama models,
  entering the prompt interactively,
  and prompt user to respond after every model message.
  (Press Enter to skip your turn)
  ```
  ./council.sh -reply
  ```

- Run the council with all available Ollama models,
  setting the /topic on the command line:
  ```
  ./council.sh "Let us work together and create world peace"
  ```
  or
  ```
  ./council.sh < test-prompts/world.peace.txt
  ```
  or
  ```
  echo "Let us work together and create world peace" | ./council.sh
  ```
- Specify which models to use in the council:
  ```
  ./council.sh -models gemma3n:e4b,mistral:7b,granite3.3:8b
  ```

- Chat between one model and the user:
  ```
  ./council.sh -reply -models mistral:7b
  ```
  
- Set the timeout (in seconds) for model responses.
  (Default is 30 seconds)
  ```
  ./council.sh -timeout 60
  ```

- Show timestamps with every message:
  ```
  ./council.sh -timestamp
  ```

- Wrap lines to # characters
  ```
  ./council.sh -wrap 80
  ```

- Usage help:
  ```
  ./council.sh -h
  ```

- To stop the council, press **Control-C**
  - You may have to wait until the current model finishes responding before the chat will stop.
