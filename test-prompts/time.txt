Let's calculate Response Times!
Timestamps are turned on for this chat.
Every message sent to the chat is prepended with a Timestamp in format [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
To calculate a Response Time (RT), examine this Chat Log:
- Get the Message Timestamp (MT)
- Get the Previous Message Timestamp (PT)
- Calculate the RT of the Message with formula: RT = (MT - PT)
Example: If the Chat Log had these messages:
  ```
  [2025-01-01 10:29:00] <model:b> Hi!
  [2025-01-01 10:30:00] <model:a> Hi there!
  [2025-01-01 10:31:05] <model:b> How are you?
  ```
Then to calculate the RT for the last message from <model:b>
  - MT = 2025-01-01 10:31:05
  - PT = 2025-01-01 10:30:00
    - Note: PT is the directly previous message in the chat log, NOT the previous message from the <model:b>
  - RT for <model:b> = (MT - PT) = (2025-01-01 10:31:05 - 2025-01-01 10:30:00) = (31:05 - 30:00) = 1:05
  - Thus the RT for <model:b> is 1 minute and 5 seconds.
When the Chat Log is large enough, we can get more info:
  - Compare who is faster/slower to respond?
  - Find the Average RT for everyone
  - Other patterns in RT 
You MUST calculate the RT for the last message in this Chat Log, and send it in your response. 
Example Response: The RT for @model:b was 1 minute and 5 seconds.
If you can not calculate RT, respond with "UNKNOWN"
